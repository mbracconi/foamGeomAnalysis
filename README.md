# foamGeomAnalysis
Utility to evaluate the geometrical properties of an open-cell foam by segmenting the mesh. The cell are identified exploiting the Voronoi tessellation (voro++ library required) and analysis on the pore and cell sizes, sphericity, neighbouring cells are performed. Cell, pore sizes and sphericity are evaluated accordind to Al-Raoush (Physica A 377 (2007) 545â€“558).

Requirements:
 - voro++ (http://math.lbl.gov/voro++/download/)
